The idea is to break the traditional request/response cycle that traditional web app development contrains you to by moving the vast majority of the application into a series of separate, fault tolerant components. The heart of this is a rather nifty library called ZeroMQ (or 0mq). ZeroMQ is a library that abstracts away a lot of the messy details of BSD socket management, leaving you with a nice, familiar layer that allows you to focus on the way you want your networked application to talk with other networked applications. I wont go into too much detail here about ZeroMQ as the official website explains things much better than I ever could.<p class="good" cfclass="good" heading="false"> Mongrel2 is a ZeroMQ enabled web server. We can use Mongrel2 as a connector to our archipelago of inter-networked applications. For example, Mongrel2 can connect to our handler app pr push requests to it. We can process those requests, fire them off into our event driven system asynchronously, and respond to the user quickly. In situations where the processing may take some time, we can return a HTTP 201 Accepted, and continue in the background, firing off events as we process the request for other components to pick up and process. Add to this GO’s awesome go routines, we can get some pretty cool multi threaded, fault tolerant, load balanced systems built, all with a traditional  HTTP front end.<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> Published: March 30, 2011<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> Filed Under: Uncategorized<p class="bad" cfclass="short" heading="false"> Leave a Comment<p class="bad" cfclass="short" heading="false"> Required Name: Required, not published Email: Homepage:<p class="bad" cfclass="short" heading="false"> Comment:<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> Cancel Reply<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> « Previous Post<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> Next Post »<p class="bad" cfclass="short" heading="true"> Elsewhere<p class="good" cfclass="bad" heading="false"> WordPress Manifest © ReSTafarian.
